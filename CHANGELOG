v 0.5.5
  - In the ActiveRecord adapter for pagination, avoid an odd low-level AR bug when counting complex queries by using a simple Enumerable `length` call instead of the AR `count` method
v 0.5.4
  - Ensure that Instructions wrap a Hash with indifferent access
  - Wire up both adapters for the PaginateProcessor
  - Fix bug where ActiveRecord Paginator didn’t offset pages correctly
v 0.5.3
  - Extract logic for creating new ActiveSet instance after an operation into separate method
  - Ensure that the instructions logged for the paginate operation handle defaults
v 0.5.2
  - Add an ActiveRecord adapter for the PaginateProcessor
  - Update the EnumerableAdapter for the PaginateProcessor to more consistently handle edgecases
      When asking for a page number that is outside of the meaningful range (e.g. page 10 of a collection that would only have 5 meaningful pages), should return an empty collection.
  - Ensure that the built up intstruction and the base size of the original set are readable from any chained instance of ActiveSet
v 0.5.1
  - Fix bug where `transform` method tried to return a new instance of ActiveSet. It should simply returned the transformed value.
  - Fail if tranformer can’t handle passed format
  - Fix bug where Paginator wasn’t returning the proper result
  - Ensure the `String#titleize` method is available for the Instruction::Entry
v 0.5.0
 - Ensure the titleized method is delegated from the Instructions::Entry class
 - Make the Instructions Keypath class more resilient against nils
 - Add a new Transfrom processor
    This allows users to transform a dataset into (right now only) CSV using hash column definitions of the sort:

    ```
    [
      { key: ‘Explit Column Header’,
         value: ‘path.to.resource.from.dataset.instance’ },
      { value: ->(item) { mutate(item.attribute(=) } }
    ]
    ```
v 0.4.4
  - Ensure that the ActiveRecord filterer can handle Rails4 AR::Relations not responding to :methods on the underlying class
  - Test scopes defined using the helper but also as simply class methods
v 0.4.3
  - Properly specify the version dependency on ActiveSupport
v 0.4.2
  - Ensure that the `transform_keys` method is available for Hashes by bringing in the ActiveSupport module
  - Fix bug in handling string keypaths passed in from Processors
  - Set the Ruby version for this project
v 0.4.1
  - Soften the constraint on the ActiveSupport dependency
  - Don't require ActiveSupport methods that are no longer used in the processors
  - Add a `titleized` method to the KeyPath object
v 0.4.0
  - fix bug with filtering against falsey values
  - remove hack of casting DateTime and Time objects to Integer for filtering
  - add support for ActiveRecord :time columns
  - ensure that an adapter is only run if necessary for a particular instruction; that is, try to process the instruction with the first adapter, if it succeeds, don't run any other adapters, if it doesn't, try the next adapter, etc.
  - allow ActiveRecord sets to be filtered by a scope method
v 0.3.1
  - Implement an Instructions object layer for handling the hashes passed into Processors
v 0.3.0
  - remove the typecasting functionality
  - bug fixes
  - improved specs
v 0.2.0
  - allows for filtering and sorting enumerable collections via associated attributes
v 0.1.0
  - initial version
  - allows for filtering, sorting, and pagination enumerable collections via direct attributes
