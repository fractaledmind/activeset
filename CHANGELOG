  - fix Rubocop offenses (safely)
v 0.8.3

v 0.8.0

  - split the strategy files from the operation files
  - update how ActiveRecord filtering works
    + instruction operators must now be ARel methods, not SQL operators
  - memoize the `transform_to_sortable_numeric` method
v 0.7.1
  - Fix a small bug with Enumberable filtering of metaprogrammatically defined getter methods
v 0.7.0
  - another rewrite from the ground up
  - allow each operation to exist and function in its own way and in its own context
  - only write tests against the public interface of the ActiveSet class, not any internal classes
  - attempt a proper and complete sorting implementation that offers multi-dimensional, multi-directional sorting for either ActiveRecord or Enumerable sets
v 0.6.5
  - Fix the ActiveRecord filtering adapter to use the correct operator (=) for Oracle WHERE clauses
v 0.6.4
  - Add multi-column sorting for ActiveRecord collections

v 0.6.3
  - Fix a typo in the CSV transform adapter
v 0.6.2
  - ensure that the default paginate instructions are saved into the ActiveSet#instructions attr
v 0.6.1
  - fix bug with ActiveSet#method_missing blowing up when the delegated method properly returned a false Boolean
v 0.6.0
  - rewrite from the ground up
v 0.5.8
  - Avoid a possible error path where relations with a '#union' would blow up when using '#merge' because the '#order' operation was being built with the relation and not with the relation's base class
v 0.5.7
  - Fix bug where filtering wasn't updating the new ActiveSet instances #total_count
  - Add that this gem now does transformations to the README
v 0.5.6
  - Ensure that the default value for instructions when building filtering queries is '=' and not '=='
  - Allow the default value for the instructions keypath's operator to be passed in
v 0.5.5
  - In the ActiveRecord adapter for pagination, avoid an odd low-level AR bug when counting complex queries by using a simple Enumerable `length` call instead of the AR `count` method
v 0.5.4
  - Ensure that Instructions wrap a Hash with indifferent access
  - Wire up both adapters for the PaginateProcessor
  - Fix bug where ActiveRecord Paginator didn’t offset pages correctly
v 0.5.3
  - Extract logic for creating new ActiveSet instance after an operation into separate method
  - Ensure that the instructions logged for the paginate operation handle defaults
v 0.5.2
  - Add an ActiveRecord adapter for the PaginateProcessor
  - Update the EnumerableAdapter for the PaginateProcessor to more consistently handle edgecases
      When asking for a page number that is outside of the meaningful range (e.g. page 10 of a collection that would only have 5 meaningful pages), should return an empty collection.
  - Ensure that the built up intstruction and the base size of the original set are readable from any chained instance of ActiveSet
v 0.5.1
  - Fix bug where `transform` method tried to return a new instance of ActiveSet. It should simply returned the transformed value.
  - Fail if tranformer can’t handle passed format
  - Fix bug where Paginator wasn’t returning the proper result
  - Ensure the `String#titleize` method is available for the Instruction::Entry
v 0.5.0
 - Ensure the titleized method is delegated from the Instructions::Entry class
 - Make the Instructions Keypath class more resilient against nils
 - Add a new Transfrom processor
    This allows users to transform a dataset into (right now only) CSV using hash column definitions of the sort:

    ```
    [
      { key: ‘Explit Column Header’,
         value: ‘path.to.resource.from.dataset.instance’ },
      { value: ->(item) { mutate(item.attribute(=) } }
    ]
    ```
v 0.4.4
  - Ensure that the ActiveRecord filterer can handle Rails4 AR::Relations not responding to :methods on the underlying class
  - Test scopes defined using the helper but also as simply class methods
v 0.4.3
  - Properly specify the version dependency on ActiveSupport
v 0.4.2

  - Don't require ActiveSupport methods that are no longer used in the processors
  - Add a `titleized` method to the KeyPath object
v 0.4.0
  - fix bug with filtering against falsey values
  - remove hack of casting DateTime and Time objects to Integer for filtering
  - add support for ActiveRecord :time columns
  - ensure that an adapter is only run if necessary for a particular instruction; that is, try to process the instruction with the first adapter, if it succeeds, don't run any other adapters, if it doesn't, try the next adapter, etc.
  - allow ActiveRecord sets to be filtered by a scope method
v 0.3.1
  - Implement an Instructions object layer for handling the hashes passed into Processors
v 0.3.0
